Only time will tell a miss for a match
I think you've found the niche
Now I am twenty one
Young, but still getting older
Now I've been wanting more
Than what you have taught me
To show me the rivers, show me the rivers
Life living underneath a billboard
The sidewalks infested the people of plastic
Ok, so I've been holding out
Lying my weight on the door
Up above, I've never felt so numb
Until I made it out
They put a target on your forehead
The day that you were born
I've waited my entire life
Sitting on the sides
Everyday I hear you say that
It gets easier with time
A life I never ruined
A light to show me out this time
And maybe, and maybe I was right all along
The day you were born, a solid mark
Do you believe in everything?
Do you believe in everything
And everyone you meet?
Do you believe in everything?
Do you believe in everything
And everyone you see?
The day that you were born
A solid mark written on your forehead
The day you were born
A solid mark written on your forehead
The day you were born
A solid mark written on your forehead
The day that you were born
A solid mark written on your forehead
On your forehead
