Who am I?
I am Keith Lee

Out of the frying pan and into the fire
The path of battle has appeared and
I am (Lee)
I am (Lee)
I am (Lee)
All rise and bask in his glory

My drive is limitless
You won't compare to this
I have been chiseled from granite
And given a shot of adrenaline
You are the enemy
Standing in front of me
Now watch what I do when the train coming through
Your position is fantasy

My time, my shine
Ready to attack on the one dime
Limitless
Limitless
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Lee

Out of the frying pan and into the fire
The path of battle has appeared and
I am (Lee)
I am (Lee)
I am (Lee)
All rise and bask in his glory (Lee)
Out of the frying pan and into the fire
The path of battle has appeared and
I am (Lee)
I am (Lee)
I am (Lee)
All rise and bask in his glory

My rise is limitless
You're struck with bitterness
'Cause your views about me are imageless
I have stepped into new vividness
Feeling the surge is electrical
Gives me a wealth of new energy
Life imitating art, imitating life
This is my reality, vigilant

My time, my shine
Ready to attack on the one dime
Limitless
Limitless
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Lee

Out of the frying pan and into the fire
The path of battle has appeared and
I am (Lee)
I am (Lee)
I am (Lee)
All rise and bask in his glory (Lee)
Out of the frying pan and into the fire
The path of battle has appeared and
I am (Lee)
I am (Lee)
I am (Lee)
All rise and bask in his glory (Lee)

Out of the frying pan and into the fire
The path of battle has appeared and
I am (Lee)
I am (Lee)
I am (Lee)
All rise and bask in his glory
