I'm saying goodbye
To any limitation
I'm saying hello
To the God of all creation

There are no limits, with You
There are no limits, with You

You're limitless
Nothing's too hard for You
You're limitless
There's nothing You cannot do
You are bigger, and You're greater
And You're stronger I know
You're limitless, You're limitless
